# Tic Tac Toe with AI

## About
Everybody remembers this paper-and-pencil game <br/>
from childhood: Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts <br/>
and crosses or Xs and Os. A single mistake usually <br/>
costs you the game.

Let's try your skill with the power of AI! <br/>
There are 3 levels of difficulty available: easy, medium, and hard. <br/>
As long as you can win with easy and medium level bot <br/>
for the hard one *you can run, but you can't hide!* <br/>
You must acknowledge the superiority of the machine. <br/>
If you are good enough, you can get a **draw**, otherwise <br/>
bot will take advantage of your mistakes and outplay you <br/>
using power of **minimax algorithm**. <br/>

## How to play
You can play with your friend, with bot, or just watch bots' match. <br/>
To start the game type: *start X user O user* <br/>
Available commands: <br/>
*start, user, ease, medium, hard, exit* <br/>

example:
*start user medium* - which means user is X player and bot <br/>
is O player with a medium level of difficulty. <br/>

*start medium hard* - medium and hard bots will play each other.
